    abstract = {The application of an extended form of von Bertalanffy's growth function to plant data is considered; the equation has considerable flexibility, but is used only to supply an empirical fit. In order to aid the biological analysis of such growth data as are capable of representation by the function, general rate parameters are deduced which are related in a simple manner to its constants.},

    abstract={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DataFrames.jl is a package written for and in the Julia language offering flexible and efficient handling of tabular data sets in memory. Thanks to Julia’s unique strengths, it provides an appealing set of features: Rich support for standard data processing tasks and excellent flexibility and efficiency for more advanced and non-standard operations. We present the fundamental design of the package and how it compares with implementations of data frames in other languages, its main features, performance, and possible extensions. We conclude with a practical illustration of typical data processing operations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
